# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Renaissance man. I learn from adversity, mine or others. My goal is to share my life's lessons, in the hope that you can learn from them. As I love to say "Shit happens, keep learning!"

Thoughts here are not formatted for your reading pleasure. They are my insights, not inferences and may not have references or supporting arguments. I'm enjoying exploring connections and allowing this jungle to grow unfettered and uninhibited. If you prefer reading carefully pruned pieces, please visit my [blog](reddy2go.com).
